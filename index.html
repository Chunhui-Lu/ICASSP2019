    <div> This page describes the details of our LSTM based TTS engine used to generate speech samples for A/B preference test.</div>
    
    <div> Our engine follows a classic statistical parametric speech synthesis architecture, which includes front-end, back-end and vocoder.</div>

    <div><b>front-end:</b> Front-end processes the raw input text to generate input linguistic features. Text normalization, pos tagging, prosodic boundary prediction 
      
      and g2p are included in this process. The linguistic features are 628-dim contatins 591-dim binary features and 37-dim numerical features.</div>
    
    <div><b>back-end:</b> Back-end includes duration model and acoustic model. Duration model is a 3-layer BLSTM model which 
      
      contains 512 nodes(256 for each direction) in each layer. Acoustic model is a DNN-LSTM based model which contains a DNN layer
    
      of 256 nodes and 2 upper layers of LTSM with 256 nodes.</div>
    
    <div><b>vocoder: </b> We used WORLD vocoder to reconstruct speech from predicted 187-dim acoustic parameters.</div>
